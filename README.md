# Project-Evolution

Runs on a Proccessing IDE

Simulation of a world of boids and monsters that feed on boids. The monsters can mate and reproduce and die, and have their own individual DNA, so evolutionary algorithm was used to trace the evolution of the species and various flocking/fleeing algorithms were incorporated into the boids to observe group behaviours. 

There have been 5 stages to this project :-
1. V1 : Only Boids. From the "Nature of Code" in References
2. V2 : Monsters as spectators
3. V3 : Monsters can breed and reproduce
4. V4 : Debugged version. Recommended to test
5. V5 : Still in beta stage, evolutionary adaptions with DNAs

This project was an extension of the flocking project from the book "[The Nature of Code]"(https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-Examples) by Daniel Shiffman.
